# helper_Functions
Repository for my custom helper functions for web development.
The first function will be my navigation builder. Simple (probably over done) javascript navagation builder that requires 2 arrays, is a list of  text for links, and the other for the actual list of file names/urls. 
Working on adding drop down possibilities but for now this is just a plain Top level navigation generator. On the page it is require to have a ul or an ol with an ID.
