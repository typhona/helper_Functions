# helper_Functions
Repository for my helper functions for web development*.

*Pre installed patented SHABLAKA!(Its just simple magic and wizardry.)

Simple (probably over done) javascript navagation builder that requires 2 arrays, one is a list of  text for links, and the other for the actual list of file names/urls. 
Working on adding drop down possibilities but for now this is just a plain Top level navigation generator. 

On the page it is require to have a ul or an ol with an ID. Latest update has used the 'id' argument for calling the function as a prefix for making classes in the resulting links.

The footer.js is a super simple way to keep footer text uniform across an entire site.
